					This project was completed in collaboration with 
					<a class='auiLink' href="mailto:hirt.corinna@gmx.de">Corinna Hirt</a> and
					<a class='auiLink' href="mailto:kalle.r.reiter@hfg-gmuend.de">Kalle Reiter</a>
					at the <a class='auiLink' href="https://www.hfg-gmuend.de">HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd</a>.
					The aim of the course (Invention Design, 
					<a class='auiLink' href="https://www.hfg-gmuend.de/en/Prof._Joerg_Beck.html">Prof. Jörg Beck</a>) is to research future-focused technologies and design for interactions that may arise when these technologies mature. An emphasis was placed on anticipating the societal impact of these technologies and accounting for potential pitfalls in our designs. For this project, Kalle, Corinna, and I decided to research artifical intelligence and machine learning technologies.

					Artificially intelligent software is already common-place; neural networks analyze our emails and credit card statements, come pre-installed on most smartphones, and have even begun to permeate into medical and legal decision-making. These algorithms are both powerful and dangerous, particularly when the researchers that built them don't know exactly how they makes predictions. Unlike humans, algorithms cannot explain themselves. 
					<br> <br>
					More insidiously, artificially intelligent systems are used to mine our opinions and influence our behavior–usually with the objective to maximize profit or user engagement–without the necessary foresight. In huge populations, slight changes in behavior and opinions can have enormous, unpredictable consequences. Research indicates that these "intelligent" systems are eroding our attention spans, mental health, and democratic values [<a class='auiLink' href="https://ledger.humanetech.com/">Center for Human Technology</a>].
					<br> <br>
					Solutions to these problems will undoubtedly involve progress in policy-making and AI interpretability research. However, in this project, we approached the problem from a <strong>design thinking</strong> perspective. We asked ourselves,
					<ul>
						<li>How might we design systems to have empathy for a user's emotions and wellbeing?</li>
						<li>How might we design systems to intelligently interpret and react to human behavior along human dimensions?</li>
						<li>What if human-computer interaction were as rich and fullfulling as human-to-human interaction?</li>
					</ul>

					Our project converged around the concept of adaptive user interfaces. 
					<blockquote>
						An <strong>Adaptive User Interface (AUI)</strong> is a user interface that dynamically adjusts its layout, elements, functionality, and/or content to a given user's needs, capabilities, and context of use.
					</blockquote>
					The project has two compontents:
					<ol>
						<li>an interactive "smart-mirror" installation</li>
						<li>a demo website outlining our research and design guidelines</li>
					</ol>
